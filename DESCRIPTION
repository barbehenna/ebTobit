Description: Estimation tools for multidimensional Gaussian means using
    empirical Bayesian g-modeling. Methods are able to handle fully observed data as
    well as left-, right-, and interval-censored observations (Tobit
    likelihood); descriptions of these methods can be found in Barbehenn and
    Zhao (2023) <arXiv:2306.07239>. Additional, lower-level functionality based
    on Kiefer and Wolfowitz (1956) <doi:10.1214/aoms/1177728066> and Jiang and
    Zhang (2009) <doi:10.1214/08-AOS638> is provided that can be used to
    accelerate many empirical Bayes and nonparametric maximum likelihood
    problems.
