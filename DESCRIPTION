Description: Estimation tools for multidimensional Gaussian means using
    empirical Bayesian g-modeling. Methods are able to fully observed data as
    well as left-, right-, and interval-censored observations (Tobit
    likelihood). Additional, lower-level functionality is provided that can be
    used to accelerate many empirical Bayes and nonparametric maximum likelihood
    problems.
